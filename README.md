# React + Vite
# Password Generator web App
I'm creating password generator app using react , vite and tailwind css.
Creating this project to learn lots of concept for example hooks like, useState,useCallBack, useEffect and useRef.
To use for useEffect to solve the re-rending problem.
To use for useCallBack to optimize the application for better performance.
To set a bydefault langth of input field 8 charcter.
To use to checkbox first is for number allocation and second character allocation.
To check a number box to set a number and check a character box set a character.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
